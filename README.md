Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

    git clone git://github.com/christopherstyles/dotfiles.git

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    brew bundle dotfiles/Brewfile

Install:

    rcup -d dotfiles -x README.md -x LICENSE -x Brewfile

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. The `-x`
options, which exclude the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `Brewfile` files, are
needed during installation but can be skipped once the `.rcrc` configuration
file is symlinked in.

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.gvimrc.local`
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`
* `~/.bashrc.local`
